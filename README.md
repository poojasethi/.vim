# .vim
My .vimrc, plugins, and such.

Notes:
1. To install the plugins, run `:PlugInstall`. The plugin manager is [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). It's under the `autload` directory.
2. [Optional] If you make & install vim from [source](vim.org/git.php), it's a bit tricky to build with `python3` support. I found these two pointers pretty helpful [[1](https://allanchain.github.io/blog/post/compile-vim-python3/), [2](https://gist.github.com/lv10/487732f22513196f9f91c1e7119b5911)].
